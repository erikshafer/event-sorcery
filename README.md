## What is Event Sorcery?

Event Sorcery is a tool for .NET developers to assist with application development surrounding the software design patterns of Event Sourcing and CQRS.

This library for .NET is:
 - Unambitious
 - Opinionated
 - Currently designed for usage with [Marten](https://martendb.io/) and [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).
   - With support for [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/) after initial scaffolding.

This all has been largely driven by finding myself writing the similar snippets of code over and over for multiple projects.

## Documentation

Coming soon.


## Change Log

Actual logs coming soon. For now, they're notes-to-self.

- 2022-Jul-12: Extended functionality. Largely influenced by the Marten, Akka.NET, EventFlow, Eventuous APIs. Trying to get the best of all these worlds. Marten implementation will be first, followed by EventStoreDB. May make MediatR pipelines opt-in instead of opt-out.
- 2021-Dec-12: stood up project after talking about it for months
