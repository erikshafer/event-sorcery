## What is Event Sorcery?

Event Sorcery is a tool for .NET developers to assist with application development surrounding the software design patterns of Event Sourcing and CQRS.

This library for .NET is:
 - Unambitious
 - Opinionated
 - Currently designed for usage with [Marten](https://martendb.io/) and [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).

This all has been largely driven by finding myself writing the similar snippets of code over and over for multiple projects.
