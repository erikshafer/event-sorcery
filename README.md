# Event Sorcery

*build statuses go here.*


## What is Event Sorcery?

It's a tool to assist with application development surrounding the software design patterns of Event Sourcing and CQRS.

This library for .NET is:
 - Opinionated
	- Snippets of code I find myself requently recreating and trying to fine-tune
 - [Marten](https://martendb.io/)-oriented (dependent)
   - meaning [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for event log persistence
	- does not mean projections have to be bound to PostgreSQL
 - Attempts to use common .NET best practices where applicable
 - More bullet points in the future
